# TIME-SERIES-FORECASTING-OF-BRENT-CRUDE-OIL-PRICE-USING-REGRESSION-AND-LSTM
This study focuses on utilizing a regression model and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to forecast the Brent oil stock price over the past two decades, commencing from 1988. In the case of the regression model, the research explores the delineation of independent variables employed to forecast the Brent oil price. Subsequently, these variables are incorporated into a regression model to anticipate future Brent oil prices.

In the LSTM approach, the historical Brent oil prices serve as input to construct a matrix, with the LSTM recognizing these values as actual prices along with the associated look-back (lag). The LSTM undergoes learning with this newly formed dataset, enabling it to predict future Brent oil prices.

A line chart depicting the trends in the changes in brent oil stock price for the last 20 years (from 1988 to 2022) is shown below. The stock price reached its peak in 2008 and dropped significantly afterwards. It however recovered progressively after the major drop.
